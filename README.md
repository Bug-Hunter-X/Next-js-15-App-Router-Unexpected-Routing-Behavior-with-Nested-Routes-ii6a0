# Next.js 15 App Router Unexpected Routing Behavior with Nested Routes

This repository demonstrates an unexpected routing behavior in Next.js 15's App Router when using nested routes within the `app` directory. The issue involves unexpected page transitions or rendering of incorrect components.

## Bug Description

The original `index.js` demonstrates a basic Next.js 15 app. However, upon adding nested routes or using more complex routing structures, unexpected behaviors, such as incorrect page rendering or navigation issues, arise.

## Solution

The `index.fixed.js` illustrates potential solutions and workarounds for this unexpected routing behavior.  This may involve restructuring routes, using proper layout components, or careful implementation of route handling within the app directory.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
